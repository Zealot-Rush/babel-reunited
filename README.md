# Babel Reunited

> “Now the whole world had one language and a common speech… But the Lord said, ‘Come, let us go down and confuse their language so they will not understand each other.’”

Long ago, humanity dared to build a tower that reached toward the heavens. Unified in language and ambition, they worked as one—until their speech was scattered, and their understanding fractured. The Tower of Babel stood unfinished, not because they lacked tools, but because they no longer shared meaning.

Today, in the age of AI, we’re given a chance to reverse that fate.

**Babel Reunited is a plugin for [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/). It allows every participant to write in their native language—and still be fully understood by others, in theirs. It’s an automatic translation layer powered by AI, designed not just to translate, but to restore something once lost: seamless, universal human dialogue.**

Whether you’re writing in Chinese, Spanish, or English, your message will be instantly translated for everyone in the forum, without needing to switch languages or rely on copy-paste tools. This is not just a convenience feature—it’s a philosophical one.

We are rebuilding the tower. Not toward heaven, but toward understanding.
